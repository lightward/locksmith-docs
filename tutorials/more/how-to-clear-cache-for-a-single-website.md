# How to clear cache for a single website

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide is geared towards merchants on Shopify using the Locksmith app. If you are arriving from elsewhere, you may still find it useful - simply down scroll to the section for the browser you are using.

## Why this is useful

If you are using Locksmith's passcode, secret link, newsletter, or location key-condition types on your Shopify store, Locksmith remembers access of specific visitors via browser cache. Once the lock is open, the locked content will be accessible and will begin to appear in searches and collection view (if applicable) for the rest of the visitor's browser session.

If you want to re-test what a new user would, you will need to use a browser with clean cache. Keep in mind that you may find it easier to simply open up an **incognito window,** or use a **different browser or device**. However, those steps can be tedious if you would like to test multiple times in quick succession.

Following the steps in this guide will help you clear the cache for a single website, **without needing to clear the cache for all websites**. GIFs included!
