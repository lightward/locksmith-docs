  How to set up Locksmith locks to hide from collections, in-store searches, and
  any other lists and grids in your Shopify Online Store

# Hiding products and other content from lists in your online store

Locksmith allows you to hide _locked_ content from lists across your store. This includes hiding products from collections and search result pages - only showing them to visitors that have gained access to the appropriate lock(s). This is turned on in your lock settings on your lock page:

## Hide products from the following:

* Searches
* Collections
* Related products
* Featured products
* And more! Any time your theme is showing a list of products, this feature likely has the ability to filter locked products from it - _as long as the list is not displayed by a third party app._

## Other resource types

Although less commonly needed, you can also turn this feature on for page, blog, and article locks. In these cases, if your theme has a way to display "all pages", or "all blogs", for example, Locksmith can remove these from from those types of displays as well.

## Limitations

* Using **third party apps** that take over the display of your collections or searches will likely prevent Locksmith from hiding products correctly. Most filtering/search/display apps are **not compatible** with hiding products via Locksmith.
* Hiding a large number of products this way can introduce **blank spaces** to your collections. [More information and workarounds here](../../faqs/faq-i-see-blank-spaces-in-my-collections-and-or-searches-when-locking.md).
* While this setting is capable of hiding products from the search results _page_, it cannot always remove products from search results that are fetched dynamically (i.e. shows results as you type).
* This setting cannot hide filtering options in your theme's filter menu (shown on collection pages), as filter items are displayed differently from product grids and navigation menus.
