# Creating weekly schedules

## Creating the lock

You can add this to any lock type including your entire store, or a lock on a specific product, collection, page, etc. To create a lock on your entire store, for example, choose that from the list:

## Adding the schedule

On the lock page, after creating a key, choose the 'weekly schedule' key condition. You can start to type "weekly" or "schedule" to narrow down the list quickly:

From there, setting up the schedule should be intuitive. You'll see a section for each day, and you'll be able to add as many time periods for each day as you need, in case your opening hours are not sequential.&#x20;

This condition _always_ uses the time zone setting for your store. There is not a way to edit this in Locksmith. If you want to change which time zone is used, you'll need to [change the time zone for your store](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/intro-to-shopify/initial-setup/setup-business-settings#set-or-change-your-store-time-zone).
{% endhint %}

## Special dates

If you have different hours on specific dates, you can add those as well in the "Special dates" section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Adding no time periods to a day of the week or a special date means the schedule is set to close on that day.
{% endhint %}
