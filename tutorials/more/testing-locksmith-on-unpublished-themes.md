# Testing Locksmith on unpublished themes

By default, Locksmith will only automatically install itself to and update itself on the currently published theme, and does _not_ automatically install itself to unpublished themes. However, there is a way to test Locksmith on unpublished themes.&#x20;

### **To test Locksmith on an unpublished theme:**&#x20;

1. Head to the in-app "Themes" page.
2. &#x20;Click the "**Install**" button for the theme you'd like to test Locksmith on:

4. To preview the lock configuration you just installed, click the **three-dot menu** (…) next to the theme name, and select **Preview**:

When testing your locks on unpublished or the currently published theme, we recommend using a brand new private browsing session each time:\
[how-to-use-a-private-browsing-session.md](how-to-use-a-private-browsing-session.md "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note: when making changes to your locks and Locksmith settings, Locksmith will only update those on the currently published theme. \
\
To update the unpublished theme after making changes in-app, just click the "Install" button for that theme next to the theme name again, as outlined above.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### To remove Locksmith from an unpublished theme:

1. Head to the in-app "Themes" page.
2. &#x20;Click the "**Uninstall**" button for the theme you'd like to remove Locksmith from:

### Setting a secondary theme:

Locksmith supports setting a **Secondary theme**, which receives automatic updates along with your published theme when changes are made in Locksmith.

1. In the **Unpublished themes** section, locate the theme you want to set as a secondary theme.
2. Click the **three-dot menu** (…) next to the theme name.
3. Select **Set as secondary theme**:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-09 at 9.20.07 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This theme will now receive all future updates made in Locksmith, in addition to the published theme.
