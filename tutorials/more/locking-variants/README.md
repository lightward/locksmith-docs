# Locking variants

Manage pricing and other options by creating multiple variants, and use Locksmith to manage access.

In addition to managing access to your products and collections, Locksmith can protect individual variants _within_ your product listings.

**This is a powerful feature! It can allow you to tune your product listings in a way that previously required elaborate coding, or deep manual integration with other apps.**

With variant locking, you can:

* ... set up wholesale pricing on your existing products without creating duplicate products, then ensure that only your wholesalers can view those prices.
* ... reserve a certain amount of stock for a particular customer.
* ... allocate your inventory by distribution center, and restrict access regionally.
* ... add bulk quantities for your trade customers, only allowing pre-approved customers to access it.

**Note: This feature may conflict with other apps. See the **_**Incompatibilities**_** section below for more.**

### Creating a variant lock

Start by ensuring you've got at least one product variant set up in your catalog. (Learn how to set these up [for new products](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/variants#creating-variants-for-a-new-product), and [for existing products](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/variants#creating-additional-variants-of-an-existing-product).)

Then, open Locksmith, and search for the name of your variant:

**Note:** if you don't see your variant in the search results, try opening up the "Help" page in Locksmith and pressing the \
Update Locksmith button there, and try your search again. This is sometimes necessary if you've very recently created your variant.

Next, select the variant and click Save. You may then add your keys.

That's it! :)

### Compatibility with other apps

Because this feature allows you to filter out variants from view, it's likely that it will conflict with any other apps that _also_ operate in this way. To learn more about this, see the page here:

Variant locking is _not_ compatible with page builder apps. To learn more about this, see the page here:
