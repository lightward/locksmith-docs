  How to set up Locksmith locks to hide from collections, in-store searches, and
  any other product grids in your Shopify Online Store

# Hiding products from product-grids

Locksmith allows you to hide _locked products_ from products grids across your store - including other collections and search result pages - only showing them to visitors that have gained access to the appropriate lock(s). This is turned on in your lock settings on your lock page:

## Limitations

* Using **third party apps** that take over the display of your collections or searches will likely prevent Locksmith from hiding products correctly. Most filtering/search/display apps are not compatible with hiding products via Locksmith.
* Hiding a large number of products this way can introduce **blank spaces** to your collections. [More information and workarounds here](../../faqs/faq-i-see-blank-spaces-in-my-collections-and-or-searches-when-locking.md).
* While this setting is capable of hiding products from the search results _page_, it does not remove products from dynamic/dropdown (shows results as you type) searches.
