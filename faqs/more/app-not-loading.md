# The app isn't loading. What do I do?

Deep breaths! We can figure this out. :)

1. Check [status.uselocksmith.com](https://status.uselocksmith.com/) for platform updates.
2. Try accessing Locksmith's app domains directly:
   * Try opening [uselocksmith.com](https://uselocksmith.com/) directly.
   * Try opening [ui.uselocksmith.com](https://ui.uselocksmith.com/). (You should be redirected to [uselocksmith.com/auth/login](https://uselocksmith.com/auth/login); this is normal.)
3. If loading fails, try again from a private/incognito browser session.
4. If that doesn't work, try again from another device.
5. If that doesn't work, try again from another network. (Switch WiFi networks, or switch to cellular.)

If these steps don't reveal the issue and a path for resolving it, write to [team@uselocksmith.com](mailto:team@uselocksmith.com) with the following details:

* How far you got in the list above
* The contents of [myip.wtf/text](https://myip.wtf/text) and [myip.wtf/headers](https://myip.wtf/headers)
* A screenshot from [ipv6test.google.com](https://ipv6test.google.com/)
* A screenshot (including the browser's URL bar) of the app failing to load
