# How do I hide menu navigation links to my locked resources

The following Locksmith lock types all have a lock option that can be used to conditionally hide menu navigation links to locked resources:

* Product
* Collection
* Page
* Blog
* Liquid locks

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: this feature is not compatible with mega-menus and most navigation menus managed by third party apps. This lock option is designed to work with the stores native menu navigation system.
{% endhint %}

## Using the lock option

Select a lock for your list of locks on the Locksmith apps homepage. On the right hand side of the lock's settings page, under the "For unauthorized guestsâ€¦" section, there will be a "**Hide any links to this...**" option. Enable this option to hide navigation links to resources covered by this lock.&#x20;
