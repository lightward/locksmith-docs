# Can Locksmith protect shipping methods, billing methods, or coupon codes?

**No - It's not possible to protect shipping methods, billing methods, or coupon codes.**

Shopify keeps a pretty tight leash on the checkout process itself, and third-party apps aren't permitted to get involved here at this time.

If you absolutely must set up different shipping or billing terms, your best bet may be to set up a completely new Shopify store.
