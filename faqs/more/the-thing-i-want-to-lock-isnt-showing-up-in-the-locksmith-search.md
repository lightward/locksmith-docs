# The thing I want to lock isn't showing up in the Locksmith search

If a collection, product, page (etc) isn't showing up in the search results when you're setting up a lock, try specifying a resource type in your search, like this:

* blog:marketing
* collection:tops
* page:sales
* product:blue

{% hint style="info" %}
