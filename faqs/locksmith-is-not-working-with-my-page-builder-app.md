# Locksmith is not working with my page builder app

Merchants frequently have issues with Locksmith and page building apps such as **GemPages** or **PageFly.**

This is a hard area to have full compatibility since those particular apps specialize in letting merchants have full control over the look and feel of the pages. This is a great thing, of course, but it does make it hard for apps such as Locksmith to come in after the fact and also attempt to control the display.

That being said, **if you are using Locksmith in a more standard way** - i.e. using full-page locks on some of your products or collections, there's still a good chance that you can use both.&#x20;

If you're not sure, the following points should clear up when not to use the apps together...

## Editing your pages while Locksmith is active

Even when using standard Locksmith locks, you may still find that you cannot edit your pages while Locksmith is active. The best way to get around this is to simply **disable Locksmith** while you are editing your pages. This can be an inconvenience, and we apologize for that in advance. You can disable Locksmith from the **Settings** page in the app.

## Hiding prices, the add-to-cart button, or other types of manual locking on your pages

Locksmith's [manual locking features](../keys/more/manual-mode.md) are NOT compatible with page builder apps, it is **not recommended** to try to use both, and Locksmith support cannot help with this.

## Variant locking

Locksmith's [variant locking](locksmith-is-not-working-with-my-page-builder-app.md#undefined) works similarly to manual locking, and is **also not compatible** with page building apps.
