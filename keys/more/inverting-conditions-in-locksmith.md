# Inverting conditions in Locksmith

There are many instances in which it is useful for a key to grant access if the _opposite_ of your key condition is true.&#x20;

Locksmith makes it easy to invert keys. To do so, simply click the box next to "invert" when you're editing the key:

Notice that when this is done, the wording will update, inverting the key condition logic:

Make sure to "Save" the lock, and you're done!
