# Requests from Locksmith

Locksmith occasionally makes requests to a shop's Online Store, starting with the shop's `myshopify.com` subdomain and then following redirects as necessary. (For example, Locksmith might request `https://lightward.myshopify.com/`, and then follow the redirect to `https://lightward.shop/`.)

Locksmith may make these requests to scan shop content or to verify Locksmith configuration, among other reasons.

Requests coming from Locksmith are identified with the following user agent header format, where `$VERSION` is Locksmith's own internal version identifier and `$SHOP` is the identifier for the Shopify store on whose behalf Locksmith is operating.

```
user-agent: Locksmith/v$VERSION (uselocksmith.com; +$SHOP.myshopify.com)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Occasionally we'll see a store's non-Shopify security layers or proxies have an issue with Locksmith's requests. If you're using a service like Cloudflare or Edgemesh, a good place to start is by checking request logs for this user agent.

Remember: user agent strings can be easily spoofed. Security-by-user-agent is not a great practice.
