# Locksmith Admin API

Locksmith's Admin API can be used to query Locksmith to get information about your locks, keys, and settings. As a REST API, it closely resembles [Shopify's own REST Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest).

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike Locksmith's [Storefront API](locksmith-storefront-api.md), the Admin API is intended for use by other application code. It is not intended to be built into a user-facing browser experience. This mirrors Shopify's own published APIs: Shopify's Admin API is meant for apps, whereas Shopify's Storefront API is meant for user-facing browser experiences.

Because of this, Locksmith's Admin API does not include [CORS support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). This means that client-side browser JavaScript (e.g. JavaScript code added directly to the theme) will encounter CORS errors if it tries to call this API.

### Versions

Locksmith's API versions correspond directly with Shopify's API versions, and are supported in the same way. [Read more about Shopify's API versioning](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/versioning)

To retrieve a list of current Shopify API versions – and therefore a list of Locksmith API versions – see [https://app.shopify.com/services/apis.json](https://app.shopify.com/services/apis.json).

### Authentication

Accessing Locksmith's API requires two headers:

* `x-shopify-shop-domain` – must be of the format "example.myshopify.com"
* `x-locksmith-access-token` – must be an enabled access token, generated in your Locksmith settings

Using cURL, one might access the API this way:

```
curl \
   --header "x-shopify-shop-domain: example.myshopify.com" \
   --header "x-locksmith-access-token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
   https://uselocksmith.com/api/unstable/shop.json
```

### Endpoints

* **GET https://uselocksmith.com/api/:version/shop.json**\
  Returns Locksmith's entire configuration for your store
* **GET https://uselocksmith.com/api/:version/locks.json**\
  Returns an array of all locks in your Locksmith account
* **GET https://uselocksmith.com/api/:version/locks/:id.json**\
  Returns data for a single lock in your Locksmith account
* **POST https://uselocksmith.com/api/:version/install**\
  Requests a full Locksmith installation, in the currently published theme

### Conventions

* Do not rely upon data keys that are prefixed with an underscore (e.g. "\_foobar"). They are subject to change or removal at any time.

### Generating an access token

To access this API, generate an access token. You can find these toward the end of your settings area:

Use the "Add access token" link to add your first token.

Once created, an access token may be edited to enable/disable it, or to change its name. It may also be deleted.\
