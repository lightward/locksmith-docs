# Locksmith's pricing policy: Pay what feels good

_(2020-03-20) A note, in light of COVID-19: This has been our official pricing policy since January 2020. It took us a while to distill what we know/feel down to this specific policy; but, this is the heart of how we've operated from the beginning, and it's how we handle pricing for all of our offerings (see_ [_lightward.com_](https://lightward.com/)_). While this way of doing business has proved integral for many of our existing customers, it's all the more important as the world finds its way forward._

Our top priority is to create health for ourselves, and to give you the best tools we can for creating health for you. (We interpret "health" broadly: healthy transactions created in healthy business can enable health in a million other areas.)

We believe (a) that the financial side of this is as important to get right as the technical side, and (b) that the best way to guarantee healthy financial movement is through clear and invitingly open conversation.

In practice, here's what that means:

1. When you install our app, we suggest a subscription price for you based on the cost of your Shopify plan, based on the prices that Shopify publishes. In general, we'll suggest a third of the Shopify plan cost.
2. If you want to keep using our app, and the price feels good to you, you pay it – no further conversation needed.
3. If the price we suggest doesn't feel good, you tell us what price _does_ feel good to you. This is important: the price we suggested was based on what we were able to see about you, but we're not claiming to know your entire story. In this part of the conversation, we rely on you to improve our knowledge of what's right for you, by asking you _specifically_ what price you'll feel good paying.
4. Our turn! If we can meet you at that number, we will. We'll update your account with the price you talked about, and we'll all move forward from there. (If we can't, then we'll talk about that too – it'll be our turn to execute step 3.)

_A note about “what feels good”: when talking about numbers, it’s that sweet spot where you feel you’re appropriately investing in something. Only you know what that number is for you, where you’re neither straining yourself to afford the thing, nor paying a number that represents undervaluing what you receive. If that gives you pause, it’s okay. Take a minute and feel it out. :)_
